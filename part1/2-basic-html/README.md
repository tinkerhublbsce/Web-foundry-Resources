## Basics of HTML


This is the structure of a basic HTML Document
```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Page Title here</title>
    </head>
    <body>

        Write anything here
        
    </body>
</html>
```

Let me Break it down for you
- `<!DOCTYPE html>` - Used to decalre that it is a HTML5 Document
- `<html>` - The whole HTML document is written inside the the `<html>`and`</html>` tag
- `<title>` - Used to define the title of your webpage
- `<body>` - Everything you see inside the browser are written inside the `body` tag
 
Now Here's the list of some really useful tags
- `<div></div>`
- `<p></p>`
- `<span></span>`
- `<b></b>`
- `<i></i>`
